# Collection of input and outputs from Sidekick's chatbot feature.

**Note:**  

1. **Formatting of logs**:  
    ```
    Input:
    <user prompt>
    Decompiled Code (<IL level>):
    <decompiled code>
    Output:

2. **Formatting of decompiled code**:
    ```
    <memory address>|   <decompiled code>
    ```  
3. **Conversation continuation**:  
- All rounds of a conversation will be recorded as `Round <round number>`
- All conversation logs with the same number are continuations of the same instance conversation with the LLM. 
- For conversations with only `1 set of decompiled code`, the decompiled code will only be logged in `Round 1` of the conversation. (Will be tagged with: `same as above` for clarity)
- For conversations with `multiple sets decompiled code`, the decompiled code will be included in the Round where the new decompiled code is introduced into the conversation. (Will be tagged with: `new function introduced here` for clarity)
## Tests done on non-stripped binaries.

**Output**:
```
The `main` function appears to be a multi-level challenge or validation routine. Here's a detailed breakdown:  
1. **Input Prompt**: 
The user is prompted to enter a string.\n\n  
2. **Level 1 Check**:
- The program reads a string into `buf_1` and checks its length.
- If the length is not 6, it prints a failure message for Level 1.
- If the length is 6, it proceeds to Level 2.
3. **Level 2 Check**;
- It checks if a specific character (`var_47`) is equal to `0x34`.
- If not, it prints a failure message for Level 2.
- If it is, it proceeds to Level 2.5.  
4. **Level 2.5 Check**:
- It checks if the first character of `buf_1` is `0x33`.
- If not, it prints a failure message.
- If it is, it proceeds to the next stage.  
5. **Second Input Prompt**:
- The user is prompted to enter a second string.  
6. **Level 3 Check**:
- It checks if the length of the second string matches the length of the first string.
- If not, it prints a failure message.
- If it matches, it performs a loop to check if each character of the second string, when adjusted, matches twice the corresponding character of the first string.
- If any character fails this check, it prints a failure message and breaks the loop.
- If all checks pass, it prints a success message for Level 3.  
7. **Bonus Level Check**:
- The user is prompted to enter a value.
- It checks if the length of the first string (`rax_1`) is `0x1b39`.
- If not, it prints a failure message for the bonus level.
- If it matches, it prints a success message for the bonus level.  
Finally, the function returns 0, indicating successful execution.

#### Round 2
**Input:**  
```
provide step by step instructions to solve this crackme
```

**Decompiled Code:**  
`same as above`

**Output:**
```
Here's a step-by-step guide to solving this crackme based on the `main` function:

1. **Level 1: String Length Check**  
- Input a string with exactly 6 characters when prompted. This will pass the first check.
2. **Level 2: Character Check**   
- Ensure that the character at `var_47` is `0x34`. This might be a hardcoded value or a result of some operation. You may need to investigate how `var_47` is set or manipulated before this check.
3. **Level 2.5: First Character Check**   
- The first character of your input string (`buf_1`) should be `0x33`, which is the ASCII value for '3'. Start your string with '3'.
4. **Level 3: Second String Input**
- Enter a second string when prompted. Ensure the length of this string matches the first string (6 characters).
- For each character in the second string, ensure that when adjusted by subtracting `0x30`, it equals twice the corresponding character in the first string (also adjusted by `0x30`).
- This implies a mathematical relationship between the characters of the two strings.
5. **Bonus Level: Length Check**
- The program checks if the length of the first string (`rax_1`) is `0x1b39`. Since this is not possible with a 6-character string, this condition will always fail unless there's a specific manipulation or context not visible in the current decompilation.
6. **General Tips**   
- Use a debugger to step through the program and observe how variables are set and manipulated.
- Pay attention to any hardcoded values or operations that might affect the checks.
- Consider edge cases and how input might be transformed or validated.
By following these steps, you should be able to navigate through the levels of this 
crackme challenge.
